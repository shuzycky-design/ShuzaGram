-- Admin console accounts.

-- Until now the panel had exactly one operator: TELESRV_ADMIN_UI_PASSWORD /
-- _TOKEN, signed into a session whose actor was the literal string "admin" and
-- whose rights were TELESRV_ADMIN_UI_PERMISSIONS (default "*"). That is kept
-- as a break-glass login -- an operator locked out of the database must still
-- be able to get in -- but named accounts now live here.
--
-- Named "admin_console_users" rather than "admin_users": admin_user_id
-- already means "the user who administers this chat/channel" across
-- secret_chats, channel_invites and friends, and reusing that noun for panel
-- operators would read as the same thing.
