// Panel session authorisation and CSRF.
//
// The panel authenticates with a cookie, which is what makes it a CSRF target:
// a request forged by any other origin arrives with the operator's session
// attached. Two independent checks close that.
//
// 1. Double-submit token. At login the server mints a random token, publishes it
//    in a readable cookie (telesrv_admin_csrf) and requires the same value in the
//    X-CSRF-Token header of every mutating request. A cross-origin page can make
//    the browser *send* the cookie but cannot read it, so it cannot produce the
//    header. Double-submit is the right shape here specifically because this
//    process keeps no server-side session store: the session lives entirely in a
//    signed cookie, so there is nowhere to park a per-session token, and the
//    stateless variant is the one that survives a restart and a second replica.
//    The token is additionally bound into the signed session claims, so a
//    cookie-writing neighbour (a sibling subdomain) cannot supply a matching
//    cookie/header pair of its own choosing either.
//
// 2. Origin agreement. When the browser states an Origin, it must be this host.
//    That catches a forged request from a page that somehow does hold a token.
//
// Both comparisons are constant time, for the same reason the session MAC is.

// Panel permission names. They match the strings an operator configures in
// TELESRV_ADMIN_UI_PERMISSIONS and the ones the admin API enforces.
